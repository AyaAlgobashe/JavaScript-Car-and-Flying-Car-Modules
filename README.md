# JavaScript-Car-and-Flying-Car-Modules
This repository contains three JavaScript files: car.js, flyingcar.js, and base.js.

1- car.js module defines the Car class with properties like model and year, along with a toString function to display car data.
2- flyingcar.js module defines the FlyingCar class, inheriting from Car, with an additional canFly property. The toString function in FlyingCar calls the parent function and adds "I can Fly" or "I can't fly" based on canFly value.
3- base.js module creates a FlyingCar object and calls its toString function. This setup demonstrates object inheritance and method overriding in JavaScript modules.
